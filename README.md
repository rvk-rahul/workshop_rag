# Build your own RAG Chatbot with your own LLM
Welcome to this workshop to build and deploy your own Chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation with Astra DB and Ollama running your own Mistral LLM.

It leverages [DataStax RAGStack](https://docs.datastax.com/en/ragstack/docs/index.html), which is a curated stack of the best open-source software for easing implementation of the RAG pattern in production-ready applications that use Astra Vector DB or Apache Cassandra as a vector store.

What you'll learn:
- ü§© How to leverage [DataStax RAGStack](https://docs.datastax.com/en/ragstack/docs/index.html) for production-ready use of the following components:
    - üöÄ The [Astra DB Vector Store](https://db.new) for Semantic Similarity search
    - ü¶úüîó [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) for linking Ollama running Mistral and Astra DB
- ü§ñ How to use [Ollama to run Large Language Models like Mistral](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) 

- Slides of the presentation can be found [HERE](assets/meetups-slides.pdf)



## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
This workshop assumes you have:
1. [A Github account](https://github.com)
2. [Ollama installed on your local machine](https://ollama.com/download)
   ![codespace](./assets/ollama-download.png)
3. [Run Mistral LLM powered by Ollama on your local machine](https://ollama.com/library/mistral/tags)
   ```bash
   ollama run mistral
   ```
   Trt also other versions of mistral. For example [quantized models](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization) reduce the computational and memory costs of running inference and might speed up the response in case you run on low computing resources.

4. Ensure Python 3.11 or higher is installed on your local machine. 
   We advise executing all Python commands within a virtual environment for enhanced management and isolation.
   Create a virtual Python environment named 'workshop' using the following method:
   
   ```bash 
   python -m venv workshop
   ```
   Activate the 'workshop' virtual environment as follows: 
   Windows: 
   ```bash 
   .\workshop\Scripts\activate
   ```
   MacOS and Linux: 
   ```bash
   source workshop/bin/activate
   ```
During the course, you'll gain access to the following by signing up for free:
1. [DataStax Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) (you can sign up through your Github account)

Follow the below steps and provide the **Astra DB API Endpoint**, **Astra DB ApplicationToken** when required.

### Sign up for Astra DB

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started with Streamlit to build an app

Let us now build a real application we will use the following architecture

![steps](./assets/steps.png)

In this workshop we'll use Streamlit which is an amazingly simple to use framework to create front-end web applications.

To get started, let's create a *hello world* application as follows:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Draw a title and some markdown
st.title("Your personal Efficiency Booster")
st.markdown("""Generative AI is considered to bring the next Industrial Revolution.  
Why? Studies show a **37% efficiency boost** in day to day work activities!""")
```
Begin by importing the necessary packages, starting with the Streamlit package required for the subsequent steps. Utilize st.title to add a title to the web page, followed by st.markdown to incorporate markdown content.

For launching this application locally, first install Streamlit and other dependencies required for later steps. Proceed to install all necessary dependencies immediately:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app_1.py
```

This will start the application server and will bring you to the web page you just created.

Simple, isn't it? ü§©

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Chatbot interface to the app

In this step we'll start preparing the app to allow for chatbot interaction with a user. We'll use the following Streamlit components:
1. 
2. `st.chat_input` in order for a user to allow to enter a question
2. `st.chat_message('human')` to draw the user's input
3. `st.chat_message('assistant')` to draw the chatbot's response

This results in the following code:

```python
# Draw the chat input box
if question := st.chat_input("What's up?"):
    
    # Draw the user's question
    with st.chat_message('human'):
        st.markdown(question)

    # Generate the answer
    answer = f"""You asked: {question}"""

    # Draw the bot's answer
    with st.chat_message('assistant'):
        st.markdown(answer)
```

Try it out using [app_2.py](./app_2.py) and kick it off as follows.  
If your previous app is still running, just kill it by pressing `ctrl-c` on beforehand.

```bash
streamlit run app_2.py
```

Now type a question, and type another one again. You'll see that only the last question is kept.

Why???

This is because Streamlit will redraw the whole screen again and again based on the latest input. As we're not remembering the questions, only the last on is show.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Remember the chatbot interaction

In this step we'll make sure to keep track of the questions and answers so that with every redraw the history is shown.

To do this we'll take the next steps:
1. Add the question in a `st.session_state` called `messages`
2. Add the answer in a `st.session_state` called `messages`
3. When the app redraws, print out the history using a loop like `for message in st.session_state.messages`

This approach works because the `session_state` is stateful across Streamlit runs.

Check out the complete code in [app_3.py](./app_3.py). 

As you'll see we use a dictionary to store both the `role` (which can be either the Human or the AI) and the `question` or `answer`. Keeping track of the role is important as it will draw the right picture in the browser.

Run it with:
```bash
streamlit run app_3.py
```

Now add multiple questions and you'll see these are redraw to the screen every time Streamlit reruns. üëç

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Now for the cool part! Let's integrate with Ollama running Mistral ü§ñ

Remember that Streamlit reruns the code everytime a user interacts? Because of this we'll make use of data and resource caching in Streamlit so that a connection is only set-up once. We'll use `@st.cache_data()` and `@st.cache_resource()` to define caching. `cache_data` is typically used for data structures. `cache_resource` is mostly used for resources like databases.

This results in the following code to set up the Prompt and Chat Model:

```python
# Cache prompt for future runs
@st.cache_data()
def load_prompt():
    template = """You're a helpful AI assistent tasked to answer the user's questions.
You're friendly and you answer extensively with multiple sentences. You prefer to use bulletpoints to summarize.

QUESTION:
{question}

YOUR ANSWER:"""
    return ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("system", template)])
prompt = load_prompt()

# Cache Chat Model for future runs
@st.cache_resource()
def load_chat_model():
    # parameters for ollama see: https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain_community.chat_models.ollama.ChatOllama.html
    # num_ctx is the context window size
    return ChatOllama(model="mistral:latest", num_ctx=18192)

chat_model = load_chat_model()
```

Instead of the static answer we used in the previous examples, we'll now switch to calling the Chain:

```python
# Generate the answer by calling the Chat Model
inputs = RunnableMap({
    'question': lambda x: x['question']
})
chain = inputs | prompt | chat_model
response = chain.invoke({'question': question})
answer = response.content
```
Check out the complete code in [app_4.py](./app_4.py).

Now run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app_4.py
```

You can now start your questions-and-answer interaction with the Chatbot. Of course, as there is no integration with the Astra DB Vector Store, there will not be contextualized answers. As there is no streaming built-in yet, please give the agent a bit of time to come up with the complete answer at once.

Let's start with the question:

    What does Daniel Radcliffe get when he turns 18?

As you will see, you'll receive a very generic answer without the information that is available in the CNN data.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Combine with the Astra DB Vector Store for additional context

Now things become really interesting! In this step we'll integrate the Astra DB Vector Store in order to provide context in real-time for the Chat Model. Steps taken to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation:
1. User asks a question
2. A semantic similarity search is run on the Astra DB Vector Store
3. The retrieved context is provided to the Prompt for the Chat Model
4. The Chat Model comes back with an answer, taking into account the retrieved context

We will reuse the data we inserted thanks to the notebook.

![data-explorer](./assets/data-explorer.png)

In order to enable this, we first have to set up a connection to the Astra DB Vector Store:

```python
# Cache the Astra DB Vector Store for future runs
@st.cache_resource(show_spinner='Connecting to Astra')
def load_retriever():
    # Connect to the Vector Store
    vector_store = AstraDB(
        embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings(),
        collection_name="my_store",
        api_endpoint=st.secrets['ASTRA_API_ENDPOINT'],
        token=st.secrets['ASTRA_TOKEN']
    )

    # Get the retriever for the Chat Model
    retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
        search_kwargs={"k": 5}
    )
    return retriever
retriever = load_retriever()
```

The only other thing we need to do is alter the Chain to include a call to the Vector Store:

```python
# Generate the answer by calling the Chat Model
inputs = RunnableMap({
    'context': lambda x: retriever.get_relevant_documents(x['question']),
    'question': lambda x: x['question']
})
```

Check out the complete code in [app_5.py](./app_5.py).

Before we continue, we have to provide the `ASTRA_API_ENDPOINT` and `ASTRA_TOKEN` in `./streamlit/secrets.toml`. There is an example provided in `secrets.toml.example`:

```toml
# Astra DB secrets
ASTRA_API_ENDPOINT = "<YOUR-API-ENDPOINT>"
ASTRA_TOKEN = "<YOUR-TOKEN>"
```

And run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app_5.py
```

Let's again ask the question:

    What does Daniel Radcliffe get when he turns 18?

As you will see, now you'll receive a very contextual answer as the Vector Store provides relevant CNN data to the Chat Model.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, let's make this a streaming app

How cool would it be to see the answer appear on the screen as it is generated! Well, that's easy.

First of all, we'll create a Streaming Call Back Handler that is called on every new token generation as follows:

```python
# Streaming call back handler for responses
class StreamHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    def __init__(self, container, initial_text=""):
        self.container = container
        self.text = initial_text

    def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs):
        self.text += token
        self.container.markdown(self.text + "‚ñå")
```

Then we explain the Chat Model to make user of the StreamHandler:

```python
response = chain.invoke({'question': question}, config={'callbacks': [StreamHandler(response_placeholder)]})
```

The `response_placeholer` in the code above defines the place where the tokens need to be written. We can create that space by callint `st.empty()` as follows:

```python
# UI placeholder to start filling with agent response
with st.chat_message('assistant'):
    response_placeholder = st.empty()
```

Check out the complete code in [app_6.py](./app_6.py).

And run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app_6.py
```

Now you'll see that the response will be written in real-time to the browser window.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Now let's make magic happen! ü¶Ñ

The ultimate goal of course is to add your own company's context to the agent. In order to do this, we'll add an upload box that allows you to upload PDF files which will then be used to provide a meaningfull and contextual response!

First we need an upload form which is simple to create with Streamlit:

```python
# Include the upload form for new data to be Vectorized
with st.sidebar:
    with st.form('upload'):
        uploaded_file = st.file_uploader('Upload a document for additional context', type=['pdf'])
        submitted = st.form_submit_button('Save to Astra DB')
        if submitted:
            vectorize_text(uploaded_file)
```

Now we need a function to load the PDF and ingest it into Astra DB while vectorizing the content.

```python
# Function for Vectorizing uploaded data into Astra DB
def vectorize_text(uploaded_file, vector_store):
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        
        # Write to temporary file
        temp_dir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
        file = uploaded_file
        temp_filepath = os.path.join(temp_dir.name, file.name)
        with open(temp_filepath, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(file.getvalue())

        # Load the PDF
        docs = []
        loader = PyPDFLoader(temp_filepath)
        docs.extend(loader.load())

        # Create the text splitter
        text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size = 1500,
            chunk_overlap  = 100
        )

        # Vectorize the PDF and load it into the Astra DB Vector Store
        pages = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
        vector_store.add_documents(pages)  
        st.info(f"{len(pages)} pages loaded.")
```

Check out the complete code in [app_7.py](./app_7.py).

And run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app_7.py
```

Now upload a PDF document (the more the merrier) that is relevant to you and start asking questions about it. You'll see that the answers will be relevant, meaningful and contextual! ü•≥ See the magic happen!
